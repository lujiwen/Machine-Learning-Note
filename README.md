The original sourc code is from the book <i>Machine Learning in Action</i> , thanks for the author Perter.

What i want to do is to modify the source code in python to make it a new library for repeated use in my study and experiment.

In the next few days ,I will also upload some materials, which is from other teacher and classmates. I treat it as my note to share.
